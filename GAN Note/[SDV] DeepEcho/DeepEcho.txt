ARGUMENTS:

> PARSynthesizer()

metadata (sdv.metadata.SingleTableMetadata):
    Single table metadata representing the data that this synthesizer will be used for.
enforce_min_max_values (bool):
    Specify whether or not to clip the data returned by ``reverse_transform`` of
    the numerical transformer, ``FloatFormatter``, to the min and max values seen
    during ``fit``. Defaults to ``True``.
enforce_rounding (bool):
    Define rounding scheme for ``numerical`` columns. If ``True``, the data returned
    by ``reverse_transform`` will be rounded as in the original data. Defaults to ``True``.
locales (list or str):
    The default locale(s) to use for AnonymizedFaker transformers. Defaults to ``None``.
context_columns (list[str]):
    A list of strings, representing the columns that do not vary in a sequence.
segment_size (int):
    If specified, cut each training sequence in several segments of
    the indicated size. The size can be passed as an integer
    value, which will interpreted as the number of data points to
    put on each segment.
epochs (int):
    The number of epochs to train for. Defaults to 128.
sample_size (int):
    The number of times to sample (before choosing and
    returning the sample which maximizes the likelihood).
    Defaults to 1.
cuda (bool):
    Whether to attempt to use cuda for GPU computation.
    If this is False or CUDA is not available, CPU will be used.
    Defaults to ``True``.
verbose (bool):
    Whether to print progress to console or not.
